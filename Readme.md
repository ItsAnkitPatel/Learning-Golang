## Learning Golang

This is just a simple repository to help me learn Golang. It contains various examples and exercises that cover the basics of the language as well as some advanced topics.

I am following this [Youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXQpH_kZIxTWUe-Ee-DZEX5gfeoo4tHV6)

And also I am using boot.dev's [Golang course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-golang).
